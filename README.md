#Hopup

This a personal project consisting of a custom Rails app and iOS app. The iOS app reads/writes to the Rails backend using a REST API.

Users are able to create topics that contain multiple tags. Tags refer to geotags that the user creates, containing the location and description of the tag.
Tags are grouped into topics, and the topics can be subscribed to by other users.

After a user has subscribed to a topic, push notifications will be sent to the user as they come within proximity of any tags belonging to that topic.

A login you can use is 
Username: ed@kim.com
Password: asdfgh

The rails app is hosted on a free Heroku account, so the first request may take up to 10 seconds.
